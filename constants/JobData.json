Major employers are dog kennels, circuses, marine theme parks, guide dog schools, zoos, motion picture studios, dog security services and horse breeding, racing farms and stables.\nAnimal trainers usually specialize in teaching a particular type of animal one type of behaviors. Overall, however, most animal trainers do many of the same tasks. First they must identify animals to train,- they evaluate each animal's temperment, ability and aptitude for training. Trainers may breed their own animals or acquire them from animal shelters. Other trainers are hired to train specific animals. Trainers must understand the psychology of the animals they train. Most training involves getting animals to respond to hand, voice and physical commands. Training is a slow process which requires great patience on the trainer's part. Once the animals are trained they must also teach the animal's human owners how to work with the animal. In addition to training, animal trainers must also care for the animals or hire animal caretakers toperform tasks such as exercising and feeding the animals and taking care of their living areas.\nAdvancement for some animal trainers is in the form of training more animals. Race horse trainers may advance to training more valuable animals. Animal trainers in zoos may advance to working with more difficult animals. Some trainers become supervisors of other trainers.

They are creative and practical thinkers. The work of a fine artist may be realistic, stylized, or abstract and may depict objects, people, nature, or events. Usually, fine artists specialize in one or two art forms, such as painting, sketching, sculpting, printmaking, and restoring. To complete and sell a work of art, an artist must estimate sizes, quantities, time, cost, and materials needed and judge the value of objects, services, or people.\nFine artists use an assortment of materials, including oils, watercolors, acrylics, pastels, pencils, pen and ink, plaster, clay, and computers. Painters create portraits, landscapes, and still life pictures. Sculptors design three-dimensional works of art. Printmakers create printed images from designs cut or etched into wood, stone, or metal.\nAn artist may be commissioned to create pieces of art by clients. An artist meets with the client to discuss objectives, ideas, and themes to be portrayed. Most artwork, however, is created as an original idea by artists and bought by people who like the item. The works of fine artists are typically displayed in museums, galleries, and private homes. Because there is no guarantee that artwork will sell, many fine artists hold other jobs. Only the most successful fine artists are able to support themselves solely through the sale of their works. Some teach art in high schools and colleges. Others work as administrators of arts programs. Fine artists may also work as art critics and consultants to foundations that invest in art. Most fine artists, however, work in unrelated fields to support their art careers.\nArtists work in art studios in buildings, or in private studios in their homes. Some fine artists share studio space, where they may also exhibit their work. Studio surroundings are usually well lighted and ventilated. Fine artists may be exposed to fumes from glue, paint, ink, and other materials and artists who sit at drafting tables or use computers for extended periods may experience back pain, eyestrain, or fatigue. Self-employed artists can set their own hours, but may spend much time and effort selling their artwork to potential customers or clients and building a reputation.",
